# ListMP3
A Java tool that scan your hard drives for MP3 files and create an HTML report about it.

## Goal

I've started this little project when I began to study computer programming.

The goal was to have an HTML list of the music I had on my computer.

I thought I could enhanced it to be a quick and simple media library.

## Conclusion

This project left unfinished, as reading ID3 tags was a big deal and I still had to focus on other school projects.
